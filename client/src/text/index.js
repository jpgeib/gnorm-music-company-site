            peg: "Discovered 7 years ago by the Harmony Incorporated band at a friend’s party, Peggy sang one song and they immediately recognized her talent and persuaded her to join the band. Now with Outside Chance - Peggy brings a fresh outlook with her ability to pick great songs that people love to hear.  Not only is she a great lead singer but she brings her own style to each song she sings and makes them her own.  Her infectious energy always gets the crowd going!",
            jeff: "The founder of Outside Chance. On lead guitar and keyboards (will cymbals between his knees be next?) Jeff has been playing since he first stole his father’s guitar at the age of 3. A familiar face on the Connecticut coverband scene, Jeff played for 15 years with Take Five and 8 years with Harmony Inc. He can also be found lurking about at open mic nights and area music stores! A true Beatles fanatic – his roots are in rock and roll in all its facets.  His later influences include; Terry Kath, Jeff Beck and Frank Zappa.   With a demand for excellence – he believes there is no reason a wrong chord should ever be played. Counseling may help!",
            mike: "Mike lays down the beat with his outstanding bass playing. His passion is Yes music along with Rush. A huge Chris Squire fan Mike loves to throw bass runs from some of his favorite Yes songs throughout our music.  And it always works. (no - he's not related to Danny DeVito!!)"

            lynn: "My earliest musical memories are entertaining my enraptured grandparents with vocal renditions of my favorite songs. My sister and I would alternate, waiting impatiently for the other to finish, so we could have our moment in the sun. I loved to sing and to be a singer (apparently along with the rest of the world!). I occasionally followed my dream—I sang in a girl band in grade school and briefly in my college’s classic rock band.",
            fred: "I grew up in a house where music was everywhere. My father ran a classical radio station in Washington DC and then a rock and roll station in Boston during the 60s and 70s. My mother was a piano teacher. I started off taking piano lessons from my mother, which lasted all of a couple of months.",
            bob: "Growing up in NYC, a child of the sixties, the sound of rock and roll filled the Altbaum household. To me, it was the music of my generation but that sound was destined to be classic rock. It would be thirty five more years till I would have the opportunity to play it. I started taking classical piano lessons at age eight but after 3 years became disenchanted with the regimentation of classical training. A three year hiatus was followed by one year of popular music lessons and then I felt ready to launch my music career.",
            andrew: "When it comes to performing, Andrew is very diversified.  His past endeavors include musical theater, singing telegrams, improv-style murder mystery dinner theater, and now DNR. He has played with bands throughout High School, College, Medical School and Residency.",
            kevin: "Representing the 'almost' of 'Fairfield County's Almost All Physician Band' is drummer Kevin J. Fox, who could have been a doctor if it weren't for that science thing. He has performed with all types of groups, from jazz and rock combos to concert orchestras. Kevin is thrilled to be a member of DNR. 'I would rather be with the members of this band, than with the finest people on earth'.",
            rich: "Representing the entire horn section of DNR is no small task.  It is certainly made easier when Gnorm turns up my mic (so if you can't hear me please nudge him to do so!). My sax career began when my older brother left home and left his sax behind; I gladly gave up the clarinet and got hooked on jazz.  Dexter Gordon, Wayne Shorter and of course John Coltrane are my icons."

            joel: "Joel is the Federation’s lead bass player and co-vocalist. He has been playing bass for many years, initially starting on the upright variation, then moving onto bass guitar. Some of his influences include Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Rush, which can be seen from the band’s go-to setlists. Joel has had years of experience playing and singing live, frequenting southern CT venues such as the Grey Goose, the Black Duck, and the Spotted Horse. With Joel’s bass playing, the Federation has never needed a rhythm guitarist to back Gnorm up.",
            jim: `Jim has been playing drums since he [was knee high to a grasshopper] encouraged by his drummer dad, who introduced Jim to jazz and Big Band music. At age 8, Jim discovered Led Zeppelin and Frank Zappa, and at 9 he sat in with his drum teacher's band performing at a club and was hooked. By 15, Jim was playing in local clubs (with his dad as roadie) and has regularly performed around the tri-state area [music scene] ever since. Jim is the 'go-to' drummer for many local bands, including Outside Chance, the Federation and the Cut-Outs. He also plays guitar, keyboards and electronic music.`

            daria: "Daria is the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for the The Cut-Outs. Her musical influences include the likes of singers Mary Chapin Carpenter, K.D. Lang, and Bonnie Raitt. Initially starting her singing career with simple church choir work, she went on to provide lead vocals for local bands such as Daria and the Dreamers, and Metro alongside future Cut-Outs bassist, Dave. You’d be hard-pressed to find a better vocalist than Daria.",
            dave: "Dave is the electric/acoustic bass player for The Cut-Outs, and also provides vocals when necessary. His main musical influence is none other than Bryan Setzer, most notable for his work in Stray Cats, and the Bryan Setzer Orchestra. Dave has been around the block when it comes to the local band scene; he’s played in local groups such as Metro and Limelight prior to the Cut-Outs."

    audix: "I've been using Audix mikes for about 6 years. I started with OM5's and OM3's for vocals and D3's for guitar cab miking. I've since added the D6 kick drum mike and SCX1 condensers to my live rig. I became a dealer about 2 years ago because the product has proved itself through countless gigs.",
    boomerang: "The Boomerang is a foot-operated real-time looper. I use it to lay down tracks for myself when I'm learning songs or developing parts for new compositions. It can also be used live as a digital delay with two speeds.",
    georgeLs: "George L's solderless cable is the pro standard for custom-wired pedal boards. They recently added solderless speaker cables to the line.",
    guytron: "I have been using Guytron amps and cabs almost exclusively since November of 1998. Every now and than I try something else, only to go back to the Guytron, wondering why I bothered. One of my heads was run over by a truck during load-in. The box wascrushed and splintered, but I straightened up the tubes and did the gig. Guy Hedrick, the genius behind the amp, is a smoking player, as well as a friend.",
    radian: "Radian makes great coaxial speakers. The most notable is the Microwedge line. High power handling and 90º conical dispersion. I use RMW-1108's, RPX-108P-V's, and RPX-112P-V's.",
    weber: "Weber not only makes great speakers, they also make a full line of power attenuators, an ohm-matching box, and other interesting things. I particularly like their Blue Dog and Blue Pup speakers. The Blue Pup is the only 10-inch speaker I'm aware of that nails that Celestion Blue tone."
