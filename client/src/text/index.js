        paragraph1: `Gnorm grew up in a musical family - his grandmother played the organ at church, his classically trained mother taught him piano, and his uncle's jazz trio recorded and toured nationally. Gnorm taught himself acoustic guitar, and credits Eric Clapton's "Crossroads" with inspiring him to learn electric guitar. His musical influences include Yes, early Genesis, Hot Tuna, Rush and later Stevie Ray Vaughn and Jon Herington of Steely Dan. Gnorm studied music at the University of Bridgeport and performed with the UB concert choir. He also learned to play bass, and honed his vocals with choral singing at church camp.`,
        paragraph2: `Gnorm "lives by his ears" and will play any style of music. His signature skill is covering multiple guitar and keyboard parts on his guitar, prompting listeners to do a double take. Over the decades he has committed a sizable and varied repertoire of songs to memory, from southern rock to metal to rockabilly. Besides recording his bands' music demos, he has also contributed to friends' CDs and played a broad range of venues, from Toad's Place, the Levitt Pavilion and the Bartlett Arboretum, to local clubs and restaurants such as the Grey Goose, the Black Duck, and the Spotted Horse.`,

            peg: `Peg was at a friend’s party when she saw Jeff and Mike playing with Harmony Incorporated. They invited her to step up to the mike and sing Sweet Home Alabama - and the rest is history! The band immediately recognized her talent and persuaded her to join them on a permanent basis. Peg's influences include Fleetwood Mac and jazz-folk-blues great Eva Cassidy. Besides her musical talent as lead singer, Peg is a dynamic front-person who engages the audience with her humor and inclusive style, which is why the band has developed a loyal following of friends and band "family" who look forward to a great night of dancing and dining.`,
            jeff: `A "triple threat" on lead guitar, keyboards, and vocals, Jeff has been playing since he first stole his father’s guitar at the age of three! Jeff played for 15 years with Take Five, and 8 years with Harmony Inc., before forming Outside Chance with Peggy and Mike. Jeff is an ardent fan of the Beatles (as well as the NY Yankees and UConn Huskies). His later influences include Terry Kath of Chicago, Jeff Beck and Frank Zappa. He can be found tinkering with his beloved Stratocaster and Telecasters, learning new songs.`,
            mike: "Another Harmony, Inc. alumni, Mike provides a solid foundation for the band with his outstanding bass playing. Mike's style is anchored in Motown and R&B, from Earth, Wind & Fire to Kool & the Gang. His influences include Jaco Pastorius, Wrecking Crew regulars Joe Osborn and Carol Kaye, and of course Chris Squire - listen for Mike sneaking in bass runs from some of his favorite Yes songs! With his reliable talent and self-deprecating humor, Mike is an essential contributor to the band."

            lynn: `Lynn has loved to sing since she was a child, singing for her grandparents, with her grade school "girl band", and a classic rock band in college. She began training in classical flute as a child and has transitioned to a more improvisational style since joining DNR. Professionally, she also transitioned from corporate sales and communications skills training to real estate, and is affiliated with William Raveis. Lynn gets a kick out of fulfilling her childhood fantasy of singing and playing music - now with DNR, "such a talented and generous group of guys!"`,
            fred: "Fred grew up in a house where music was everywhere. His father ran a classical radio station in Washington DC, and then a rock'n'roll station in Boston during the 60s and 70s. Fred began piano lessons with his mother, who was a piano teacher, which lasted all of a couple of months. From there he moved on to the electric guitar and eventually the bass guitar, playing bass in various high school bands the late 60s. After focusing on college, law school, and establishing a law practice, he returned to music, playing with a local jazz band. A couple of bands later, he joined DNR. Fred loves playing with people who love what they do and giving back to the community.",
            bob: `Bob grew up in NYC with the sound of '60s rock and roll. He began piano lessons at age 8, but after 3 years became disenchanted with classical training. At 13, he formed his first band, the "Blue Shades" which he describes as "3 months of acne, voice changes [and] no gigs". Over the next 30 years, Bob earned his MD and worked as an internist in Westport, CT, playing show tunes and Chanukah music for his family. Fortunately, in 2002, three doctor friends rescued Bob from musical obscurity when they invited him play keyboard in a classic rock band, DNR, "Fairfield County's Almost all-physician rock band". Bob is delighted to play the music he loved as a teenager for patients, baby boomers, and fans of all ages, and is a proud member of what former Surgeon General Everett Koop called the "best multispecialty rock group in Fairfield County".`,
            andrew: `Andrew's diverse past performances include musical theater, singing telegrams, improv-style murder mystery dinner theater. He has played with bands throughout high school, college, medical school and residency, at the Bitter End, the China Club and even The Garden (well, not that Garden - the Beer Garden in Newark). Since Andrew joined DNR, it is his longest running project. Andrew has practiced as an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist in Norwalk since 2001. He is affiliated with Norwalk Hospital and The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, where he completed his residency.  He loves treating both children and adults, and using his training as a vocalist to assist him in caring for voice problems of fellow singers.  He is grateful to his wonderful wife Melissa for supporting his music, and loves when his kids Ethan and Daphne to come see their dad perform with his buddies.`,
            kevin: `Representing the "almost" of "Fairfield County's Almost All Physician Band" is drummer Kevin J. Fox, who could have been a doctor if it weren't for that science thing. His musical interests began with piano lessons in grammar school, and in junior high school drum lessons were added. His first public performance as a percussionist was marching with the Junior High School Band on Memorial Day, playing the triangle. Kevin has performed with all types of groups, from jazz and rock combos to concert orchestras. Kevin is thrilled to be a member of DNR and loves playing the variety of public and private engagements as well as benefit concerts with the band.`,
            rich: `Rich comprises the entire horn section of DNR (no small task!).  His sax career began when his older brother left home, leaving his sax behind; Rich gladly gave up the clarinet and got hooked on jazz. His musical icons include Dexter Gordon, Wayne Shorter and of course John Coltrane. During college and medical school, Rich continued to primarily listen to his favorite music, but after landing in NYC for medical residency, he continued studying jazz and playing with various groups, including the Boys Harbor Big Band in Harlem.  After establishing a career in Hematology/Oncology and cancer research, Rich joined the Whittingham Cancer Center at Norwalk Hospital and, soon after, DNR. Rich loves playing with his fellow DNR bandmates and playing benefit performances he especially prizes DNR's special connection with their audiences, including many of their patients.`

            jim: `Jim has been playing drums since he was knee high to a grasshopper; encouraged by his drummer dad, who introduced him to jazz and Big Band music. At age 8, Jim discovered Led Zeppelin and Frank Zappa, and at 9 he sat in with his drum teacher's band performing at a club and was hooked. By 15, Jim was playing in local clubs (with his dad as a roadie) and has regularly performed around the tri-state area music scene ever since.

You’d be hard-pressed to find a better vocalist than Daria.",
            dave: "Dave is the electric/acoustic bass player for The Cut-Outs, and also provides vocals when necessary. His main musical influence is none other than Bryan Setzer, most notable for his work in Stray Cats, and the Bryan Setzer Orchestra.

One of my heads was run over by a truck during load-in. The box wascrushed and splintered, but I straightened up the tubes and did the gig. Guy Hedrick, the genius behind the amp, is a smoking player, as well as a friend.",
    weber: "Weber not only makes great speakers, they also make a full line of power attenuators, an ohm-matching box, and other interesting things. I particularly like their Blue Dog and Blue Pup speakers. The Blue Pup is the only 10-inch speaker I'm aware of that nails that Celestion Blue tone."
