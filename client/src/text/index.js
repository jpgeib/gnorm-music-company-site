            peg: "Peg was at a friend’s party when she saw Jeff and Mike playing with Harmony Incorporated. They invited her to step up to the mic and sing Sweet Home Alabama - and the rest is history! The band immediately recognized her talent and persuaded her to join them on a permanent basis. Peg's influences include Fleetwood Mac and jazz-folk-blues great Eva Cassidy. Besides her musical talent as lead singer, Peg is a dynamic front-person who engages the audience with her humor and inclusive style, which is why the band has developed a loyal following of friends and band 'family' who look forward to a great night of dancing and dining.",
            jeff: "A 'triple threat' on lead guitar, keyboards and vocals, Jeff has been playing since he first stole his father’s guitar at the age of three! Jeff played for 15 years with Take Five, and 8 years with Harmony Inc., before forming Outside Chance with Peggy and Mike. Jeff is an ardent fan of the Beatles (as well as the NY Yankees and UConn Huskies). His later influences include Terry Kath of Chicago, Jeff Beck and Frank Zappa. He can be found tinkering with his beloved Stratocaster and Telecasters, learning new songs.",
            mike: "Another Harmony, Inc. alumni, Mike provides a solid foundation for the band with his outstanding bass playing.  Mike's style is anchored in Motown and R&B, from Earth, Wind & Fire to Kool & the Gang. His influences include Jaco Pastorius, Wrecking Crew regulars Joe Osborn and Carol Kaye, and of course Chris Squire - listen for Mike sneaking in bass runs from some of his favorite Yes songs! With his reliable talent and self-deprecating humor, Mike is an essential contributor to the band."

            lynn: "My earliest musical memories are entertaining my enraptured grandparents with vocal renditions of my favorite songs. My sister and I would alternate, waiting impatiently for the other to finish, so we could have our moment in the sun. I loved to sing and to be a singer (apparently along with the rest of the world!). I occasionally followed my dream—I sang in a girl band in grade school and briefly in my college’s classic rock band.",
            fred: "I grew up in a house where music was everywhere. My father ran a classical radio station in Washington DC and then a rock and roll station in Boston during the 60s and 70s. My mother was a piano teacher. I started off taking piano lessons from my mother, which lasted all of a couple of months.",
            bob: "Growing up in NYC, a child of the sixties, the sound of rock and roll filled the Altbaum household. To me, it was the music of my generation but that sound was destined to be classic rock. It would be thirty five more years till I would have the opportunity to play it. I started taking classical piano lessons at age eight but after 3 years became disenchanted with the regimentation of classical training. A three year hiatus was followed by one year of popular music lessons and then I felt ready to launch my music career.",
            andrew: "When it comes to performing, Andrew is very diversified.  His past endeavors include musical theater, singing telegrams, improv-style murder mystery dinner theater, and now DNR. He has played with bands throughout High School, College, Medical School and Residency.",
            kevin: "Representing the 'almost' of 'Fairfield County's Almost All Physician Band' is drummer Kevin J. Fox, who could have been a doctor if it weren't for that science thing. He has performed with all types of groups, from jazz and rock combos to concert orchestras. Kevin is thrilled to be a member of DNR. 'I would rather be with the members of this band, than with the finest people on earth'.",
            rich: "Representing the entire horn section of DNR is no small task.  It is certainly made easier when Gnorm turns up my mic (so if you can't hear me please nudge him to do so!). My sax career began when my older brother left home and left his sax behind; I gladly gave up the clarinet and got hooked on jazz.  Dexter Gordon, Wayne Shorter and of course John Coltrane are my icons."

            joel: `Joel is the Federation’s bass player, co-vocalist, and a force of nature. His monster solos and spot-on Elvis vocals turn heads at every gig. A native of Weston, CT he studied music at UConn, and also attended the Culinary Institute. Joel began playing upright bass before moving on to electric bass in his teens, and has played in bands ever since, including Banshee, Bar Car Band, and Virgil Roost rockabilly band. His musical influences include Jeff Beck, Metallica, Ozzy Osborne, Rush, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin. Joel has recently released a modern country CD, "Rollin' Down Liberty Road" (as J.Dale Rose).`,
            jim: `Jim has been playing drums since he was knee high to a grasshopper, encouraged by his drummer dad, who introduced him to jazz and Big Band music. At age 8, Jim discovered Led Zeppelin and Frank Zappa, and at 9 he sat in with his drum teacher's band performing at a club and was hooked. By 15, Jim was playing in local clubs (with his dad as a roadie) and has regularly performed around the tri-state area music scene ever since. Jim is the 'go-to' drummer for many local bands, including Outside Chance, the Federation, and the Cut-Outs. He also plays guitar, keyboards and electronic music.`

            daria: "Daria is the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for the The Cut-Outs. Her musical influences include the likes of singers Mary Chapin Carpenter, K.D. Lang, and Bonnie Raitt. Initially starting her singing career with simple church choir work, she went on to provide lead vocals for local bands such as Daria and the Dreamers, and Metro alongside future Cut-Outs bassist, Dave. You’d be hard-pressed to find a better vocalist than Daria.",
            dave: "Dave is the electric/acoustic bass player for The Cut-Outs, and also provides vocals when necessary. His main musical influence is none other than Bryan Setzer, most notable for his work in Stray Cats, and the Bryan Setzer Orchestra. Dave has been around the block when it comes to the local band scene; he’s played in local groups such as Metro and Limelight prior to the Cut-Outs."

I've since added the D6 kick drum mike and SCX1 condensers to my live rig. I became a dealer about 2 years ago because the product has proved itself through countless gigs.",
    boomerang: "The Boomerang is a foot-operated real-time looper. I use it to lay down tracks for myself when I'm learning songs or developing parts for new compositions. It can also be used live as a digital delay with two speeds.",

    guytron: "I have been using Guytron amps and cabs almost exclusively since November of 1998. Every now and than I try something else, only to go back to the Guytron, wondering why I bothered. One of my heads was run over by a truck during load-in. The box wascrushed and splintered, but I straightened up the tubes and did the gig. Guy Hedrick, the genius behind the amp, is a smoking player, as well as a friend.",
    radian: "Radian makes great coaxial speakers. The most notable is the Microwedge line. High power handling and 90º conical dispersion. I use RMW-1108's, RPX-108P-V's, and RPX-112P-V's.",
    weber: "Weber not only makes great speakers, they also make a full line of power attenuators, an ohm-matching box, and other interesting things. I particularly like their Blue Dog and Blue Pup speakers. The Blue Pup is the only 10-inch speaker I'm aware of that nails that Celestion Blue tone."
