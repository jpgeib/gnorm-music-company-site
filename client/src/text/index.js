export const audixText = "I've been using Audix mikes for about 6 years. I started with OM5's and OM3's for vocals and D3's for guitar cab miking. I've since added the D6 kick drum mike and SCX1 condensers to my live rig. I became a dealer about 2 years ago because the product has proved itself through countless gigs.";

Every now and than I try something else, only to go back to the Guytron, wondering why I bothered. One of my heads was run over by a truck during load-in.

export const radianText = "Radian makes great coaxial speakers. The most notable is the Microwedge line. High power handling and 90ยบ conical dispersion. I use RMW-1108's, RPX-108P-V's, and RPX-112P-V's.";
export const weberText = "Weber not only makes great speakers, they also make a full line of power attenuators, an ohm-matching box, and other interesting things. I particularly like their Blue Dog and Blue Pup speakers. The Blue Pup is the only 10-inch speaker I'm aware of that nails that Celestion Blue tone.";
