    audix: "I've been using Audix mikes for about 6 years. I started with OM5's and OM3's for vocals and D3's for guitar cab miking. I've since added the D6 kick drum mike and SCX1 condensers to my live rig. I became a dealer about 2 years ago because the product has proved itself through countless gigs.",
    boomerang: "The Boomerang is a foot-operated real-time looper. I use it to lay down tracks for myself when I'm learning songs or developing parts for new compositions. It can also be used live as a digital delay with two speeds.",

    guytron: "I have been using Guytron amps and cabs almost exclusively since November of 1998. Every now and than I try something else, only to go back to the Guytron, wondering why I bothered. One of my heads was run over by a truck during load-in. The box wascrushed and splintered, but I straightened up the tubes and did the gig. Guy Hedrick, the genius behind the amp, is a smoking player, as well as a friend.",
    radian: "Radian makes great coaxial speakers. The most notable is the Microwedge line. High power handling and 90ยบ conical dispersion. I use RMW-1108's, RPX-108P-V's, and RPX-112P-V's.",
    weber: "Weber not only makes great speakers, they also make a full line of power attenuators, an ohm-matching box, and other interesting things. I particularly like their Blue Dog and Blue Pup speakers. The Blue Pup is the only 10-inch speaker I'm aware of that nails that Celestion Blue tone."
