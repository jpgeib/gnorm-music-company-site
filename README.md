# Gnorm Music LLC Company Site

A new version of local CT musician's (Gnorm) company website, rebuilt with the React.js library.

## Motivation

Gnorm is a locally well-known freelance musician in the southern CT area, and he approached me to recreate his website with more modern technologies, such as React.js, for the original had become outdated.
